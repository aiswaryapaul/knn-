# Skin Disease Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This repository contains a hands-on implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify different types of skin diseases based on a dataset of skin images or features. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualizations.

## Project Overview

Skin diseases are common and early diagnosis can help in effective treatment. Machine learning models like KNN can help classify skin diseases automatically based on image or tabular data features.

In this project, we apply the KNN algorithm to a skin disease dataset to:

- Preprocess and clean the data
- Train the KNN model
- Evaluate the model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualize results with confusion matrix and other charts

## Dataset

The dataset contains features related to skin conditions (e.g., lesion characteristics, color, texture) or image features extracted from skin lesion images. (Specify the dataset source or upload your dataset here.)

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/skin-disease-knn.git
cd skin-disease-knn
